Prerequisites:

1) MikTeX - LaTeX typesetting system backend https://miktex.org/download
2) TeXMaker - LaTeX IDE/Editor http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html

* You can download other versions of the IDE/Editor eg. TeXLive, TeXWorks or use generic code editors, however IDEs allows you to compile within the program.
* TexWorks is included in the MikTeX installer but recommends TeXMaker
